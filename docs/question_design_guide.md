# Question Design Guide for Bezzerpersuit

## Philosophy: Reasoning Over Rote Memory

Good quiz questions should reward **critical thinking and deduction** rather than pure memorization. Players should be able to make educated guesses even if they don't know the exact answer.

## Multi-Category Questions

**Questions can and should belong to multiple categories.** Many topics naturally span different domains, making the game more versatile and interesting.

### Benefits of Multi-Category Questions:
- **Richer question pool**: Players get more variety when selecting a category
- **Natural connections**: Reflects how knowledge areas overlap in reality
- **Better gameplay**: Ensures each category has sufficient questions

### Examples:
- **Moon landing question** → `History`, `Science and Technology`, `Geography, Nature, and Environment`
- **Renaissance art** → `Art, Literature, and Culture`, `History`
- **Olympic records** → `Sports, Games, and Entertainment`, `History`
- **Ancient Greek philosophy** → `Mythology and Religion`, `History`, `Art, Literature, and Culture`
- **Climate change** → `Science and Technology`, `Geography, Nature, and Environment`

### Guidelines:
- Most questions should have **1-3 categories**

---

## Question Classes (Geographic/Cultural Filtering)

**Every question must have at least one question class**, which defines the geographic or cultural scope of knowledge required. This ensures fair gameplay across different regions and backgrounds.

### Available Classes:
- **`Global`** - Universal knowledge accessible worldwide
- **`Western`** - Western culture (Europe, Americas, Australia)
- **`Far East`** - East Asian culture
- **`Eastern`** - Eastern Europe / Russia
- **`Latin`** - Latin America
- **`Africa`** - African regions
- **Country-specific** - e.g., `United States`, `Denmark`, `Germany`

### Guidelines:
- Questions can have multiple classes (e.g., Berlin Wall → `['Western', 'Eastern']`, Pacific WW2 → `['Western', 'Far East']`)
- Use `['Global']` for universally accessible knowledge
- Always assign at least one class


## Question Collections

**Every question must belong to at least one collection.** Collections group questions that were added together, making it easy to manage content updates and expansions.

### Collection Strategy:
- **`Basegame`** - Core questions included in the initial release
- **Thematic collections** - Questions added around specific topics (e.g., `WW2`, `Space Exploration`, `Sports Pack`, `Movie Trivia``British Culture`, `Japanese History`)

## ✅ Characteristics of Good Questions

### 1. **Provide Context Clues**
Questions should include hints or context that help players narrow down possibilities through reasoning.

### 2. **Test Understanding, Not Just Facts**
Focus on relationships, connections, and logical deduction rather than isolated facts.

### 3. **Allow Educated Guessing**
Players with general knowledge in the category should be able to eliminate wrong answers or make informed guesses.

### 4. **Have Plausible Distractors**
Wrong answers should be believable but distinguishable through reasoning.

## ❌ Characteristics of Poor Questions

### 1. **Binary Knowledge Gates**
Questions where you either know the answer or have no way to figure it out.

### 2. **Obscure Trivia**
Facts so specific that they can't be reasoned from general knowledge.

### 3. **No Context**
Questions that don't provide any clues or connections to work with.

### 4. **Obvious Distractors**
Wrong answers that are clearly incorrect, making the question too easy.

## Examples

### ❌ Poor Question
**"What was the name of the first man on the moon?"**

**Why it's poor:**
- Binary knowledge: You either know it's Neil Armstrong or you don't
- No way to reason your way to the answer
- Pure memorization test
- Context-free fact

---

### ✅ Good Question
**"In what city was the base of operations for the moon landing that Neil Armstrong called during the mission?"**

**Why it's good:**
- Players can reason: "It's likely an American city"
- General knowledge helps: "I know NASA has centers in Houston and Florida"
- Context clues: "Base of operations" suggests a major space center
- Educated guessing is possible even without knowing Houston is the answer

**Possible answers:**
- Houston (correct)
- Cape Canaveral
- Washington D.C.
- Huntsville
