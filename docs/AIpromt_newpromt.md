# Project Context

We are building a **multiplayer quiz game** called **Bezzerpersuit** using:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth)
- **Development Tools**: MCP tools for Git and Supabase management (to be configured)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

As described in `@readme.md`, this is a fresh project start with plans to implement:
1. Real-time multiplayer quiz gameplay
2. Player progression and achievements
3. NPC opponents for practice
4. Leaderboards and social features

For complete architecture details, see `@docs/AIDescriptions_coregame.md`.
